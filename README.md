# Songrequest Bot [WIP]

This project is inspired by [TrojanerHDs Songrequest Bot](https://github.com/TrojanerHD/Songrequestbot).

Different from the original this bot has a seperate nodejs backend and a browser frontend. This way the bot can run on a seprate computer/server (better for streaming).

The whole project is made in Typescript and the frontend uses the Vue framework.

## Build instructions
```
$ yarn
$ yarn run build
$ yarn run start
```
You can build and run the project but it is still Work In Progress
